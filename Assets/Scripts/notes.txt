2/18 - starting from "Generation the Entire Maze"
	The maze it using the same code but does not fill the entire space, 
	it seems that there is a missing check to for maze walls which are at the edge of the grid.
	In addition unfilled tiles are not checked or re started from during maze generation. read further into the algorithem and grok why they are not working.
